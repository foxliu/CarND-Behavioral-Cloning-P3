    "I decided not to modify the model by applying regularization techniques like Dropout or Max pooling. Instead, I decided to keep the training epochs low: only three epochs. In addition to that, I split my sample data into training and validation data. Using 70% as training and 30% as validation. \n",

    "\n",
    "Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. Also, the data provided by Udacity, I used the first track and second track data. The simulator provides three different images: center, left and right cameras. Each image was used to train the model.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. Solution Design Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "My first step was to try the LeNet model with three epochs and the training data provided by Udacity. On the first track, the car went straight to the lake. I needed to do some pre-processing. A new Lambda layer was introduced to normalize the input images to zero means. This step allows the car to move a bit further, but it didn't get to the first turn. Another Cropping layer was introduced, and the first turn was almost there, but not quite.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step was to use a more powerfull model: nVidia Autonomous Car Group The only modification was to add a new layer at the end to have a single output as it was required. This time the car did its first complete track, but there was a place in the track where it passes over the \"dashed\" line. More data was needed. Augmented the data by adding the same image flipped with a negative angle. In addition to that, the left and right camera images where introduced with a correction factor on the angle to help the car go back to the lane. After this process, the car continues to have the same problem with the same \"dashed\" line. I needed more data, but it was a good beginning.\n",
